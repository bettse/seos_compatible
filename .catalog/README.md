## Keys

**The app uses all zero keys by default**. If you'd like to use your own keys/ADF OID, use the format of the  `keys-example.txt` to specify them, and place into `SD Card/apps_data/seos/`.

- **No key files**: If no key files are present, the app defaults to all zeros (00) for keys and an ADF OID of 030107090000000000 ("0.3.1.7.9.0.0.0.0.0").  
- **keys.txt**: If `keys.txt` is present in `SD Card/apps_data/seos/`, it is automatically loaded at launch
- **Additional key sets**: Other key files named `*_keys.txt` (e.g., `work_keys.txt`, `home_keys.txt`) can be placed in the same directory and selected via the Key Switcher in the app menu
